Our /dist/custom-elements build has been removed in favor of a faster treeshakeable /dist/components build. We anticipate very few people are using this build. To check if your project is affected, you can do a global find for 'astro-web-components/dist/custom-elements' in your project. If you are using this build, switch to 'astro-web-components/dist/loader' instead.
