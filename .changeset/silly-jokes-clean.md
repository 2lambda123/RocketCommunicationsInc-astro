Updating the **Status Symbol** page on the Astro UXDS website. This page had text changes to be made referring to light theme, sections that were no longer relevant needed to be removed, color swatches for status symbol needed to be updated with the appropriate hex, RGB, and CSS values for light, dark, and light border. Compliance Rules needed to be updated.
